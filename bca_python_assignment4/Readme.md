# Air Quality Data Visualizer – Report

## 1. Introduction
This project analyzes AQI pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, AQI) to study air quality patterns across cities.

## 2. Data Cleaning
- Missing values handled using forward/fill strategies
- Date column converted to datetime
- AQI recalculated for consistency

## 3. Statistical Analysis
Includes:
- Daily averages
- Monthly averages
- AQI min, max, std deviation
- Top 10 peak pollution days

## 4. Visualizations
Four required plots:
1. Daily AQI trend (line)
2. Monthly PM2.5 average (bar)
3. PM2.5 vs PM10 correlation (scatter)
4. Subplot of AQI + PM2.5

## 5. Observations
- Winter months show higher pollution
- PM2.5 and PM10 show strong correlation
- Delhi exhibits highest AQI levels in dataset

## 6. Conclusion
This project fulfills all Assignment 4 requirements for analysis, grouping, visualization and reporting.
