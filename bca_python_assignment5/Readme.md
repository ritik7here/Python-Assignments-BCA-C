# Smart Student Performance Analyzer  
## Capstone Project — Problem Solving with Python  
### Course Code: ETCCCPP103 | Program: BCA (AI & DS) | Semester: I  

# Overview

The **Smart Student Performance Analyzer** is an end-to-end Python project that processes academic performance data, cleans and validates it, models students using Object-Oriented Programming, performs statistical analysis, and generates meaningful visual insights through a multi-chart dashboard.

This project integrates concepts from **Python fundamentals**, **control structures**, **functions**, **OOP**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **file handling**, and **Matplotlib** — covering Units 1–4 of the course.

# Features

### Data Loading & Cleaning
- Reads CSV files securely  
- Cleans missing or invalid data  
- Validates marks (0–100)  
- Automatically generates sample dataset if not found  

### Statistical Analysis
- Per-student: Total, Average, Grade  
- Subject-wise: Mean, Min, Max, Std. Dev  
- Top & bottom performers  
- Attendance correlation  

### Object-Oriented Design
- `Student` class (marks, average, grade, to_dict)  
- `StudentManager` class (CSV loading, grouping, stats)  
- Clean separation of logic & responsibilities  

### Visualization Dashboard (2×2 Matplotlib Figure)
- Bar chart — Student average marks  
- Pie chart — Grade distribution  
- Line chart — Subject-wise average  
- Scatter plot — Attendance vs Average  

### Reporting & File Handling
- Exports:
  - Cleaned CSV  
  - Summary table  
  - Generated dashboard PNG  
  - Text-based performance report  

### CLI Menu System
- Load data  
- Preview cleaned data  
- Build students  
- Generate dashboard  
- Export outputs  
- Quick run mode  

## Dashboard Preview

The generated dashboard includes:

1. **Bar Chart** — Avg marks by student  
2. **Pie Chart** — Grade distribution  
3. **Line Chart** — Subject-wise averages  
4. **Scatter Plot** — Attendance vs Average
